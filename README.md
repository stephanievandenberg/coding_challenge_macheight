## Task
This script finds pairs of integers from a list that sum to a given value. 
The function takes as input the list of numbers as well as the target sum.

## How to run the script
1. Open a terminal and change to the directory where you cloned the gituhb repository.

   Example input: 1, 5, 6, 2, 7
4. Press enter to submit your input
5. If your input was not a list of integers, the application will ask you to 
    enter the input again, until the input is correct.
6. The application will ask you to enter the target sum. This number should
    be an integer. 
    Example input: 9
7. Press enter to submit your input
8. If your input was not an integer, the application will ask you to 
    enter the input again, until the input is correct.
9. The application will execute the function to find pairs of the input list 
    that sum the input target, and will show said pairs in the console. 
    If there are no pairs that sum the target, the application will show the 
    following message:
    "There are no pairs of numbers in the input that sum the target sum"
